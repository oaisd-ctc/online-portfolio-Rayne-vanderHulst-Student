            <p> Hello I'm Rayne Vanderhulst, I'm in Highschool, I have done cheer all the way to highschool.
                At the start of my junior year I began the Careerline Tech Center program. Through my sending school,
                Allendale High School.
                I joined the Software and Game Development class where I learnd to coding in differnt languages but
                mostly focusing on C# Joining this program I gain EXperience by working in groups and problem solving
                skills.
                I loved making games I have always wanted too but I didn't know where to start. This class has showed me
                so much stuff.
